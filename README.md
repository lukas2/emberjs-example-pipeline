## Ember.js App "Pipeline"

I have created this app in order to learn a little bit about [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com "Ember.js Website").

The Ember-code and the stylesheets are in the `/public`-directory. Everything else is a standard Rails-application.

[There's a post and a video explaining this code on my blog.](http://lukaszielinski.de/blog/posts/2013/02/23/ember-dot-js-code-walkthrough-video/ "Link to video tutorial blogpost")
